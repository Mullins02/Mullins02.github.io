        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Hi, I'm Camron Mullins! 👋</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a dynamic and dedicated
          <strong>Computer Engineering Student</strong> with a strong passion
          for <strong>data analysis</strong> and
          <strong>software development</strong>. My journey has been shaped by
          hands-on experiences in Microsoft Azure deployment, MySQL database
          enhancement, and Python Flask application development. I’ve had the
          privilege of contributing to significant projects, from creating
          Terraform scripts for AWS to leading digital transformation
          initiatives.
        </p>

        <h3>My Professional Journey 🚀</h3>
        <p>
          During my recent co-op at <strong>Cenovus Energy</strong>, I was
          engaged in pivotal Digital Transformation initiatives. I architected
          and executed a comprehensive data dictionary, transforming corporate
          data repositories into coherent, logical data models. At
          <strong>NL Eats Community Outreach Inc.</strong>, I played a key role
          in developing a Python Flask application for hydroponic systems,
          modernizing MySQL databases, and deploying solutions using Microsoft
          Azure. My experience also includes a Software Engineer Internship at
          <strong>Verafin</strong>, where I upgraded and migrated legacy code
          and created Terraform files for AWS tasks.
        </p>

        <h3>What I’m Working On Now 🛠️</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, I’m focused on furthering my knowledge in
          <strong>data warehousing and analytics</strong> and exploring advanced
          web programming techniques. I’m actively working on projects that
          combine my skills in <strong>Java, C#, Python, Terraform</strong>, and
          <strong>C++</strong> to build innovative solutions. Additionally, I’m
          preparing for my upcoming graduation in 2025 from Memorial University
          of Newfoundland, where I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in
          Computer Engineering.
        </p>

        <h3>Beyond the Code 🎯</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of my technical pursuits, I’m also a First Degree Black Belt
          in Chito Ryu Karate, which has taught me discipline and
          perseverance—values I carry into every aspect of my life. I also enjoy
          exploring new technologies, playing sports, and participating in
          activities that keep me balanced and motivated.
        </p>
