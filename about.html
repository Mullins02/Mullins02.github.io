          <h2>Hi, I'm Camron Mullins! üëã</h2>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm a dynamic and dedicated
            <strong>Computer Engineering Student</strong> with a strong passion
            for <strong>data analysis</strong> and
            <strong>software development</strong>. My journey has been shaped by
            hands-on experiences in Microsoft Azure deployment, MySQL database
            enhancement, and Python Flask application development. I‚Äôve had the
            privilege of contributing to significant projects, from creating
            Terraform scripts for AWS to leading digital transformation
            initiatives.
          </p>

          <h3>My Professional Journey üöÄ</h3>
          <p>
            During my recent co-op at <strong>Cenovus Energy</strong>, I was
            engaged in pivotal Digital Transformation initiatives. I architected
            and executed a comprehensive data dictionary, transforming corporate
            data repositories into coherent, logical data models. At
            <strong>NL Eats Community Outreach Inc.</strong>, I played a key
            role in developing a Python Flask application for hydroponic
            systems, modernizing MySQL databases, and deploying solutions using
            Microsoft Azure. My experience also includes a Software Engineer
            Internship at <strong>Verafin</strong>, where I upgraded and
            migrated legacy code and created Terraform files for AWS tasks.
          </p>

          <h3>What I‚Äôm Working On Now üõ†Ô∏è</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, I‚Äôm focused on furthering my knowledge in
            <strong>data warehousing and analytics</strong> and exploring
            advanced web programming techniques. I‚Äôm actively working on
            projects that combine my skills in
            <strong>Java, C#, Python, Terraform</strong>, and
            <strong>C++</strong> to build innovative solutions. Additionally,
            I‚Äôm preparing for my upcoming graduation in 2025 from Memorial
            University of Newfoundland, where I‚Äôm pursuing a Bachelor of
            Engineering in Computer Engineering.
          </p>

          <h3>Beyond the Code üéØ</h3>
          <p>
            Outside of my technical pursuits, I‚Äôm also a First Degree Black Belt
            in Chito Ryu Karate, which has taught me discipline and
            perseverance‚Äîvalues I carry into every aspect of my life. I also
            enjoy exploring new technologies, playing sports, and participating
            in activities that keep me balanced and motivated.
          </p>

          <h3>Let‚Äôs Connect! ü§ù</h3>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm always looking for opportunities to collaborate and learn.
